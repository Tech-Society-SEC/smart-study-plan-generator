# 📘 Smart Study Plan Generator
##🔹 Overview

The Smart Study Plan Generator is an AI-powered project designed to help students create personalized study plans based on their academic profile, learning style, and available free time. The system uses deep learning models to recommend study hours per subject and then maps them into a structured timetable.

This project aims to assist learners in:

Organizing study schedules effectively.

Managing time based on free slots.

Receiving adaptive study hour recommendations.

Visualizing their personalized timetable.

## 🔹 Current Progress (Work Done ✅)

So far, the following phases have been completed:

Problem Definition

Defined the main objective: build an AI system to generate personalized study plans.

Identified inputs: GPA, learning style, available free slots, etc.

Identified outputs: recommended study hours per subject and timetable generation.

Dataset Creation

Created a synthetic dataset to simulate student profiles.

Dataset includes fields like:

Student ID

GPA

Learning Style (Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic)

Free Slots (per day/week)

Preferred Study Hours

Subjects & Priorities

Data structured and stored for training the model in the next phase.

## 🔹 Upcoming Work (Next Steps)

The planned roadmap is as follows:

Phase 2: Build & train a deep neural network model to predict study hours.

Phase 3: Develop scheduler logic to map predicted study hours into free slots.

Phase 4: Streamlit integration for user interface.

Phase 5: Testing & visualization with charts and timetables.

Phase 6: Documentation & deployment (GitHub + Streamlit Cloud).

Phase 7: Final presentation & demo.

## 🔹 Tech Stack

Language: Python 🐍

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow / PyTorch (planned), Streamlit (planned), Matplotlib.

Tools: Jupyter/Colab for development, GitHub for version control.

## 🔹 Project Status

🚧 In Progress – Currently at Phase 1–2 (Problem Definition + Dataset Creation).
